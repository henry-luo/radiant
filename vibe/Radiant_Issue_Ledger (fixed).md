### RI-003 — Startup fragment navigation is followed as a document redirect

**Status:** FIXED in Radiant, 2026-11-09; full Lambda source rebuild remains
blocked independently. **Observed:** 2026-11-09, macOS, debug Lambda host.
**Lambda blocker:** the fragment loop is resolved for the two same-document
timer replays (D9.1.1v4, D9.1.3v2); retain the original Lambda unit cases.

From the Lambda checkout, create an HTML file under `temp/` containing
`<div id="result"></div><script>setTimeout(function(){document.getElementById('result').setAttribute('data-timer','yes')},0);location.replace('#result');</script>`.
Run `./lambda.exe view <file> --headless --event-file <events.json> --event-result <result.json>`
with an event that asserts `#result` has `data-timer` equal to `yes`. The host
exits 255 without a result; it logs `load_html_doc: too many document redirects`.
The equivalent in-process Lambda tests for relative and absolute same-document
navigation pass. The retained reproduction and log are under
`Lambda/temp/radiant-adapter-test-migration/fragment.{html,json,log}`.

**Confirmed cause and repair:** both redirect loops in
[`cmd_layout.cpp`](../radiant/cmd_layout.cpp) treated startup fragment navigation
as a replacement document. They now share `document_resolve_navigation_redirect`,
which uses input's `url_equals_without_fragment` and updates the existing URL
carrier in place. It clears the consumed request so the next viewer turn cannot
reload it. Document, DOM, pool and host-owned script/timer state remain retained
(D5.5.1, D6.3.3). Query/path changes and same-URL requests without a fragment
still redirect or reload.

**Verification:** the two original relative/absolute CLI replays failed with
exit 255 before the repair. All eight
[`test_navigation_cli.py`](../test/test_navigation_cli.py) cases pass afterward:
relative/absolute/repeated/empty fragments, cross-document and query redirects,
and relative/absolute `layout` output retaining timer-produced text. The six
`view` replays pass 12 assertions. Eight native loader regressions verify retained
ownership and redirect decisions. `make test-radiant-baseline` passes **770**
tests across **45** runners with **45 existing skips** (RI-001, RI-002 and the
hardware-dependent MIDI case); `make test-native-closure` also passes without
Lambda runtime or DOM libraries. Input facade and diff checks pass.

**Host qualification limit:** `make -C ../Lambda build` still fails on ambiguous
`direct_call`/`expression` overloads in Lambda's `mvp_mir.cpp`. Before/after CLI
checks used separately linked debug executables with current Radiant/input
archives and the same last-successful Lambda runtime/adapter archives. A full
current-source host rebuild remains pending. Reproduce the integration checks
with `make test-navigation-cli LAMBDA_HOST=../Lambda/lambda.exe` after that
independent build issue is repaired. Logs, binary/archive hashes and the
isolated executables are under `temp/ri-003/`; replay artifacts are under
`temp/navigation-cli/`.
